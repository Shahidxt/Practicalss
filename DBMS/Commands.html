how to create database:
<br>
create table EMP(
Empno int auto_increment key,
Ename varchar(35),
Job varchar(20),
Mgr varchar(35),
Joindate datetime default now(),
Salary int,
Comm varchar(50),
Deptno int);
<br>

insert into emp values(3,'Rahul Gosa','Salesman',
'Mgr',now(),200,'department', 3);
<br>
<!-- Display the list of employee excluding job title as ‘Salesman’ -->
select * from emp where Job = "salesman";

<br>
<!-- Display the list of employee excluding job title as ‘Salesman’ -->
select avg(Salary) from emp;

<!-- extra -->
select sum(Salary) from emp;

<!-- Change the name of employee ‘Rahul Gosai’ to ‘Jigar Dave’ -->
update emp set Ename = "Jigar Dave" where Ename = "Rahul Gosa";

<!-- Display the employee details whose name starts with ‘A’ -->
select * from emp where Ename LIKE 'A%';

<!-- Display annual salary of all employees. -->
select Ename , 12*Salary from emp;
<br>
<!-- Explain the procedure for Creating Views. With Suitable Example      -->

Views in SQL are considered as a virtual table. A view also contains rows and columns.
To create the view, we can select the fields from one or more tables present in the database.
A view can either have specific rows based on certain condition or all the rows of a table.
A view can be created using the CREATE VIEW statement. We can create a view from a single table or multiple tables.
SELECT * FROM DetailsView;
DROP VIEW view_name;
create view viewname as select * from emp where Salary >200;

<br>
<!-- Que 3.Consider the following structure 
Student_info(Student_ID,sname,Course_name,City) 
Course(c_code,title,HOD) -->


create table student_info(student_id int,
sname varchar(50),
Course_name varchar(30),
city varchar(20));

insert into student_info values(1, 'shahid', 'bca', 'mumbai');
insert into student_info values(3, 'mehmood', 'msc', 'mumbai');

<!-- Add two attributes to table Student_info as “Phone Number”and  
 “Email Address”  -->
alter table student_info add Phone_Number varchar(15);
alter table student_info add Email varchar(100);

<!-- Rename Attibutes Title to Course_name for table Course.                           -->

alter table Course rename column title to Course_name;

<!-- .ExplainPrimary Key Constraint with suitable example.    -->
The PRIMARY KEY constraint uniquely identifies each record in a table. Primary keys must contain UNIQUE values, and
cannot contain NULL values. A table can have only ONE primary key; and in the table, this primary key can consist of
single or multiple columns (fields).
<!-- <br> -->
CREATE TABLE Persons (
ID int NOT NULL,
LastName varchar(255) NOT NULL,
FirstName varchar(255),
Age int,
PRIMARY KEY (ID)
);




<!-- Explain procedure for creating Index with example. -->
An index is a data structure that allows us to add indexes in the existing table. It enables you to improve the faster
retrieval of records on a database table. It creates an entry for each value of the indexed columns. We use it to
quickly find the record without searching each row in a database table whenever the table is accessed. We can create an
index by using one or more columns of the table for efficient access to the records.
<!-- ,:<: -->
create index indexname on Students(name);
show indexes from student_info;
<!-- -->
Generally, we create an index at the time of table creation in the database. The following statement creates a table
with an index that contains two columns col2 and col3.
<!-- -->
mysql> CREATE TABLE t_index(
col1 INT PRIMARY KEY,
col2 INT NOT NULL,
col3 INT NOT NULL,
col4 VARCHAR(20),
INDEX (col2,col3)
);

<!-- A referential integrity constraint is also known as foreign key constraint. A foreign key is a key whose values are derived from the Primary key of another table.Explain Referential Integrity Constraint.     -->

The table from which the values are derived is known as Master or Referenced Table and the Table in which values are
inserted accordingly is known as Child or Referencing Table, In other words, we can say that the table containing the
foreign key is called the child table, and the table containing the Primary key/candidate key is called the referenced
or parent table. When we talk about the database relational model, the candidate key can be defined as a set of
attribute which can have zero or more attributes.

<!--  -->
The syntax of the Master Table or Referenced table is:
CREATE TABLE Student (Roll int PRIMARY KEY, Name varchar(25) , Course varchar(10) );

<!--  -->
The syntax of Child Table or Referencing table is:
CREATE TABLE Subject (Roll int references Student, SubCode int, SubName varchar(10) );

<!-- Demostrate use of ‘&’Operator by inserting 2 record in the table  -->
select * from student_info where name = 'shahid' and student_id = 1;
select * fromstudent_info where Course_name = 'bca' and student_id = 1;

<!-- Explain procedure for creating Snapshots with example.  -->
snapshot is a recent copy of the table from the database or a subset of rows/columns of a table. The SQL statement that
creates and subsequently maintains a snapshot normally reads data from the database residing server. A snapshot is
created on the destination system with the create snapshot SQL command. The remote table is immediately defined and
populated from the master table.
<!--  -->
These are used to dynamically replicate data between distributed databases. Two types of snapshots are available.
Simple snapshots
Complex snapshots
<!--  -->
Simple snapshot :
In simple snapshot, each row is based on a single row in a single remote table. This consists of either a single table
or a simple SELECT of rows from a single table.

<!--  -->
CREATE SNAPSHOT emp_snap
as select * from emp;
<!--  -->
Complex snapshot :
In complex snapshot, a row may be based on more than one row in a remote table via GROUP BY operation or result of
Multi-Table Join. This consists of joined tables, views, or grouped and complex SELECT statement queries.

Example –

CREATE SNAPSHOT sampleSnps1
AS SELECT student.rollno, student.name
FROM student
UNION ALL
SELECT new_student.rollno, new_student.name
FROM new_student;

SQL IN and NOT IN operators used to specify multiple values in a WHERE clause.
SQL IN condition used to allow multiple value in a WHERE clause condition. SQL IN condition you can use when you need to
use multiple OR condition.
SQL IN condition allow only specific value in INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, SELECT statement.
<!--  -->
select * from student_info where name not in ('shahid');

<!-- Explain any four Arithmetic functions with example.    -->
Mathematical functions are very important in SQL to implement different mathematical concepts in queries.

Some of the the major mathematical functions in SQL are as follows −

ABS(X)
This function returns the absolute value of X. For example −

Select abs(-6);
This returns 6.

MOD(X,Y)
The variable X is divided by Y and their remainder is returned. For example −

Select mod(9,5);
This returns 4.

SIGN(X)
This method returns 1 if X is positive, -1 if it is negative and 0 if the value of X is 0. For example −

Select sign(10);
This returns 1.

FLOOR(X)
This returns the largest integer value that is either less than X or equal to it. For example −

Select floor(5.7);
This returns 5.

CEIL(X)
This returns the smallest integer value that is either more than X or equal to it. For example −

Select ceil(5.7);
This returns 6.

POWER(X,Y)
This function returns the value of x raised to the power of Y For example −

Select power(2,5);
This returns 32.

ROUND(X)
This function returns the value of X rounded off to the whole integer that is nearest to it. For example −

Select round(5.7);
This returns 6.

SQRT(X)
This function returns the square root of X. For example −

Select sqrt(9);
This returns 3.

ASIN(X)
This function accepts a Sin value as the input and returns the angle in radians. For example −

Select asin(0);
This returns 0.

ACOS(X)
This function accepts a Cos value as the input and returns the angle in radians. For example −

Select acos(1);
This returns 0.

ATAN(X)
This function accepts a Tan value as the input and returns the angle in radians. For example −

Select atan(0);
This returns 0.

SIN(X)
This function accepts an angle in radians as its parameter and returns its Sine value. For example −

Select sin(0);
This returns 0.

COS(X)
This function accepts an angle in radians as its parameter and returns its Cosine value. For example −

Select cos(0);
This returns 1.

TAN(X)
This function accepts an angle in radians as its parameter and returns its Tan value. For example −

Select tan(0);
This returns 0.

<!-- .List and explain any four Arithmeticoperators with example. -->
SQL Arithmetic Operators
In Structured Query Language, the arithmetic operators are used to perform mathematical operations on the numerical
values stored in the database tables.
We can use these operators with the SELECT statement in SQL. We can also use the WHERE clause in the SELECT statement
for performing operations on particular rows.

These types of operators are used between two numerical operands for performing addition, subtraction, multiplication,
and division operations.

The arithmetic operators in SQL are categorized into the following five types:

SQL Addition Operator (+)
SQL Subtraction Operator (-)
SQL Multiplication Operator (*)
SQL Division Operator (/)
SQL Modulus Operator (%)

SELECT Column_Name_1 Addition_Operator Column_Name2 FROM Table_Name;
SELECT Column_Name_1 Addition_Operator Column_Name2 FROM Table_Name WHERE Condition;

CREATE TABLE Employee
(
Employee_ID INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
Emp_Name VARCHAR (50),
Emp_City VARCHAR (20),
Emp_Salary INT NOT NULL,
Emp_Bonus INT NOT NULL
) ;

<!-- What is the use of BetweenClause? Explain with example. -->
The SQL BETWEEN condition allows you to easily test if an expression is within a range of values (inclusive). The values
can be text, date, or numbers. It can be used in a SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE statement. The SQL BETWEEN
Condition will return the records where expression is within the range of value1 and value2.
<!--  -->

SELECT *
FROM table_name
WHERE column_name BETWEEN value1 AND value2;

<!--  -->
<!-- Explain IN and NOTIN operators with example -->


SQL IN and NOT IN operators used to specify multiple values in a WHERE clause.

SQL IN condition used to allow multiple value in a WHERE clause condition. SQL IN condition you can use when you need to use multiple OR condition.

SQL IN condition allow only specific value in INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, SELECT statement.

Syntax

WHERE column_name IN (value1, value2, ...);
SELECT * FROM users_info WHERE name NOT LIKE 'Be%';
