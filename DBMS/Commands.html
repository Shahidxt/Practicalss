<!-- Explain the procedure for Creating Views. With Suitable Example      -->

Views in SQL are considered as a virtual table. A view also contains rows and columns.
To create the view, we can select the fields from one or more tables present in the database.
A view can either have specific rows based on certain condition or all the rows of a table.
A view can be created using the CREATE VIEW statement. We can create a view from a single table or multiple tables.
SELECT * FROM DetailsView;  
DROP VIEW view_name;
create view viewname as select * from emp where Salary >200;
