how to create database:
<br>
create table EMP(
Empno int auto_increment key,
Ename varchar(35),
Job varchar(20),
Mgr varchar(35),
Joindate datetime default now(),
Salary int,
Comm varchar(50),
Deptno int);
<br>

insert into emp values(3,'Rahul Gosa','Salesman',
'Mgr',now(),200,'department', 3);
<br>
<!-- Display the list of employee excluding job title as ‘Salesman’ -->
select * from emp where Job = "salesman";

<br>
<!-- Display the list of employee excluding job title as ‘Salesman’ -->
select avg(Salary) from emp;

<!-- extra -->
select sum(Salary) from emp;

<!-- Change the name of employee ‘Rahul Gosai’ to ‘Jigar Dave’ -->
update emp set Ename = "Jigar Dave" where Ename = "Rahul Gosa";

<!-- Display the employee details whose name starts with ‘A’ -->
select * from emp where Ename LIKE 'A%';

<!-- Display annual salary of all employees. -->
select Ename , 12*Salary from emp;

<!-- Explain the procedure for Creating Views. With Suitable Example      -->

Views in SQL are considered as a virtual table. A view also contains rows and columns.
To create the view, we can select the fields from one or more tables present in the database.
A view can either have specific rows based on certain condition or all the rows of a table.
A view can be created using the CREATE VIEW statement. We can create a view from a single table or multiple tables.
SELECT * FROM DetailsView;
DROP VIEW view_name;
create view viewname as select * from emp where Salary >200;

<!-- Que 3.Consider the following structure 
Student_info(Student_ID,sname,Course_name,City) 
Course(c_code,title,HOD) -->


create table student_info(student_id int,
sname varchar(50),
Course_name varchar(30),
city varchar(20));

insert into student_info values(1, 'shahid', 'bca', 'mumbai');
insert into student_info values(3, 'mehmood', 'msc', 'mumbai');

<!-- Add two attributes to table Student_info as “Phone Number”and  
 “Email Address”  -->
alter table student_info add Phone_Number varchar(15);
alter table student_info add Email varchar(100);

<!-- Rename Attibutes Title to Course_name for table Course.                           -->

alter table Course rename column title to Course_name;

<!-- .ExplainPrimary Key Constraint with suitable example.    -->
The PRIMARY KEY constraint uniquely identifies each record in a table. Primary keys must contain UNIQUE values, and
cannot contain NULL values. A table can have only ONE primary key; and in the table, this primary key can consist of
single or multiple columns (fields).
<!-- <br> -->
CREATE TABLE Persons (
ID int NOT NULL,
LastName varchar(255) NOT NULL,
FirstName varchar(255),
Age int,
PRIMARY KEY (ID)
);



<!-- Explain procedure for creating Index with example. -->

An index is a data structure that allows us to add indexes in the existing table. It enables you to improve the faster
retrieval of records on a database table. It creates an entry for each value of the indexed columns. We use it to
quickly find the record without searching each row in a database table whenever the table is accessed. We can create an
index by using one or more columns of the table for efficient access to the records.
<!-- ,:<: -->
create index indexname on Students(name);
show indexes from student_info;
<!-- -->
Generally, we create an index at the time of table creation in the database. The following statement creates a table
with an index that contains two columns col2 and col3.
<!-- -->
mysql> CREATE TABLE t_index(  
   col1 INT PRIMARY KEY,  
   col2 INT NOT NULL,  
   col3 INT NOT NULL,  
   col4 VARCHAR(20),  
   INDEX (col2,col3)   
);
